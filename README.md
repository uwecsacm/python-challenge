# Python Challenge

---

- This challenge will incorporte skills learned at our previous event "Introduction to Python".
- We will also formally introduce classes in Python and utilize them to develop an application/command line tool, to interact with text documents.

1. Set up VSCODE
2. Install Python
3. Setup Jupyter Notebook (in VSCODE)
4. Discuss Python Classes
  - What are they?
  - What is the super() function?
  - What is inheritance?
  - Class vs. instance variables
5. Discuss some new functions
  - `isinstance()`
  - `strip()`
  - `os.system()`

6. Do the challenges!
7. Show demo of

### Elements
- Exstensibility
  - When creating the cli functionality, have students create options based on the exisiting function names, rather than hard coding.
  - Students should be able to add an additional document type (via inheritance) if they so desire.
    
- Classes
  - Inheritance should be used for the document-esque classes.
  - Magic methods should be defined when appropriate.
  - Static Variables
    
- Readability
  - Student's code should be neat, readable, and contain informative comments.
  - Using type hints
